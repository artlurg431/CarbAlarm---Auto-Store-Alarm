# CarbEAS Roblox EAS System
A roblox studio free EAS
Meant to be used with https://github.com/artlurg431/CarbScan-Self-Checkout-Machine/releases but can be used by itself

The instructions are almost exactly the same as the Self Checkout Machine

Place the CarbScanSettings folder inside of replicated **storage** make sure its in replicated storage, otherwise it will not work
If you already have it in there from the self checkout machine open the settings and make sure it is running CarbSYS version 3

If it is not replace the older settings with the new one from the EAS System, that way it will be compatible with the EAS System, and the [Self Checkout](https://github.com/artlurg431/CarbScan-Self-Checkout-Machine) version 3

Speaking of self checkout, this model will only work with [CarbScan Self Checkout Version 3](https://github.com/artlurg431/CarbScan-Self-Checkout-Machine)

Once you added the self checkout you can follow the instructions on that github, both of these products share the same settings script
